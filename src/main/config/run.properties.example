# List of Facility names
# These names will be used by Topcat over the REST API;
# each facility name in topcat.json must contain a match in this list,
# and each name must be mapped to ICAT / IDS urls.
# Edit these values to match your installation.

facility.list = LILS YFH

facility.LILS.transferUrl = http://localhost:8000

facility.YFH.transferUrl = https://your.facility.transferUrl.here

# Download transport URLs
# topcat.json can specify one or more download transport types for each facility, egs "https", "globus";
# each may have a distinct download URL (prefix). To specify the download URL for a specific facility
# and transport type, set an appropriate property as below.
# Note that the transport type will be set in requests from the Topcat Javascript application,
# but the URL to specify here should be the IDS url that will be used in the Java clients;
# so it may be that the Javascript transport type https should be mapped here to an
# internal http URL.
# If the property is not defined, Topcat will use the facility's transferUrl by default.

facility.LILS.downloadType.http = http://localhost:8080
facility.YFH.downloadType.https = https://your.facility.downloadTransferUrl.here
